Volunteer Opportunity Tracking

This repo is a web app that allows users to keep a profile of what volunteer opportunities they've participated in, and also makes it easy for users to find such opportunities, and share them through facebook.

The application was built to run on cloudfoundry, and is easily deployed in either a cloud or localhost environment.

To set up the app, simply run

git clone https://github.com/ContributingCode/92J.git

This app was built with node.js, so you'll need to download it from here: http://nodejs.org/

Once you've downloaded it, simply open a terminal in the directory where you cloned the repo (for now, navigate to the sandbox_zacattack folder) and type

  npm install

This will resolve the dependencies ot the application.

Afterward, you will need to set up an instance of mongodb.

If you are using cloudfoundry, find out more here:

http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/services/mongodb/nodejs-mongodb.html

Or go to www.mongodb.org to find out how to set up a local instance.

After the database is set up, you will need to acquire a facebook API key and secret, as well as a volunteermatch api secret.

Once you have these, simply run these commands from your terminal:

   export FACEBOOK_APP_ID=<facebook app id>
   export FACEBOOK_SECRET=<facebook app secret>
   export VOLUNTEER_MATCH_ACCOUNT=<volunteer match API account name>
   export VOLUNTEER_MATCH_KEY=<volunteer match API secret>

You could also add these lines to your .profile file so that you don't lose the environment variables everytime you close your terminal.

When you deploy to cloudfoundry, you'll need to set these variables on the cloud machine like so:

   vmc env-add <appname> FACEBOOK_APP_ID=<facebook app id>

And then you should be ready to go!  Simply point the facebook app you created to where the application is running (either localhost:3000/ or <appname>.cloudfoundry.com) and go to town :)
